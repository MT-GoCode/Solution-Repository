# Solution-Repository

Created 9.11.24. Solutions to problems that I decided to implement or reimplement after this date, and where my solutions are not stored on the cloud (i.e. not Leetcode).

Helpful setup notes for myself:
- Using VS Code <3
- Using executable /mingw64/include/c++
- using g++ compiler
- Slapped a copy of bits/stdc++.h in /mingw64/include/c++/13.1.0
- VS Code launch.json modified to consider CWD as the folder of the cpp file
- Add/remove freopen("in", "r", stdin); as you need
